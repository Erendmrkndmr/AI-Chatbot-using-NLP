# ChatBot_Project

This project entails the development of an artificial intelligence application aimed at creating a conversational bot. The chatbot utilizes deep learning techniques to comprehend user queries and provide appropriate responses. The project showcases the creation of a text-based conversational agent capable of engaging in dialogue using technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) and artificial neural networks.

The project analyzes user inputs to identify specific intents and generate suitable responses. For instance, when a user seeks information about a product or requests support for a service, the bot can produce relevant responses tailored to the user's query.

Key components of this project include training deep learning models, word tokenization, intent recognition, and response generation. Additionally, the project provides examples on how to utilize the trained model effectively.
